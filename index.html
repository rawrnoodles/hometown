                <h2>Tower of london</h2>
                <div class="places-img" id="tower-of-london"></div>
                <p>The Tower of London is a worthwhile tourist attraction to visit, the tower is well known for its rich and gruesome history within its walls and is one of the most popular attractions in London. It does get pretty busy during the summertime which may result in a long wait and because of this you may want to buy your tickets online in advance to avoid ticket lines and save time to have a longer, more enjoyable experience. You also get a beefeater as your tour guide around the campus if you choose to take a tour.</p>

                <h2>British Museum</h2>
                <div class="places-img" id="british-museum"></div>
                <p>The British Museum is good place to sightsee, home to one of the best collections of antiquities known to man, boasting 13 million artefacts gathered from various parts of the ancient world from Assyria, China, Europe, and Babylonia. There are many must-see exhibits in the museum the which include the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon Marbles. It is noted that admission is free, it is better to avoid peak times since there will be hordes of tourists.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Sky Gardens</h2>
                <div class="places-img" id="sky-gardens"></div>
                <p>If you want to see a breathtaking view of London, then it is advised that you pay a visit to Sky Garden. It is especially beautiful during sunset being surrounded by the garden and trees or you can spend your time at the restaurants and bar, while you get to appreciate the landscape. Sky Garden is free to visit; however, you will need to book in advance in order to get a ticket as booking as easily filled up.</p>

                <div class="places-img" id="renaissance-hotel"></div>
            </div>
        </div> 
        <p>It is highly recommended that you should stay in Kings Cross. It is a very convenient location to travel to and from. Harry Potter fans will be delighted as it is home to Platform 9¾ and the Harry Potter store. If you’re looking for a unique accommodation then you can stay at the Renaissance Hotel, the hotel is world-renowned and many films have been shot at this location. There are plenty of other hotels to choose from Premier Inn to The Standard.</p>

                <div class="places-img" id="the-orangery"></div>
            </div>
        </div> 
        <p>The great thing about London is that it is the home to every kind of food, you will be able to find whatever cuisine you want in this city. Fish and chips have been a British favourite and if you want to try this national dish then pay a visit to Poppies in Old Spitalfields Market. If you would like something classier then I do suggest going to eat Afternoon Tea, a place of interest for Afternoon Tea is Claridges in Mayfair or if you want to go for a less pricey option, The Orangery at the London’s Fan Museum is also a good choice.</p>

             </div>
        </div> 
        <p>There is a wide range of transports you could take in London all of which are easy to find and use. In this part, I will highlight all the most common and convenient forms of transport within the city. First of all, is the London Underground, you will be able to get anywhere you want due to its convenience. Next is buses, this is also another good choice as the bus routes also can take you everywhere and is a lot cheaper to ride on. Taxis can be taken if you’re in a hurry but generally it is not recommended as it can be quite expensive to take.

             </div>
        </div> 
        <p>The best time to visit London is March through to May. This is when the temperatures are mild, the parks are green and flowers are blooming. The prime tourist seasons are late spring to summer, prices peak around these times so you may want to avoid coming around this time. Christmas and winter is also a time where many locals and tourists roam around the city, so if you are a person who wants to avoid crowds then this might not be a good time to visit. That being said London is one of the largest cities in Europe so no matter what time of the year you go to London there will always be a crowd, the amount depends on what time you decide to go.
